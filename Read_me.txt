------- IMPORTANT NOTES ----------------:
    1. **Change in Drip-Feed Order Feature:**  
       The new version has implemented an **automatic drip-feed order** feature, unlike the older versions where it had to be done manually (resell).  
       Therefore, **you will need to manually update** any existing drip-feed orders after upgrading to the new version.

    2. **Change in Service Sync Feature:**  
       The new version has updated the **service sync feature** for each service.  
       You will need to **reconfigure the sync settings** for each service after updating.

    3. If you're using an older version such as 3.2, 3.3, or 3.4 and plan to upgrade to version 4.2,  
       please contact us at: smartpanelsmm@gmail.com for further instructions.

    4. We strongly recommend keeping your panel updated to the latest version.  
       If issues occur during the upgrade, please note that support may not be immediate.  
       Contact us only if your support license is still valid.
